Implementation Details
Backend Logic
Generate OTP:

Use a secure random number generator.
Associate the OTP with a user ID or email/phone.
Store OTP in the database with metadata:
OTP value (hashed for security).
User reference (e.g., user ID).
Expiration time.
Attempt counter.


Send OTP:

Use services like:
Twilio for SMS.
Nodemailer for email.
Customize messages (e.g., "Your OTP is 123456, valid for 5 minutes").


Verify OTP:

Check if the OTP exists for the user.
Validate against expiration and maximum attempts.
Hash the entered OTP and compare it with the stored one.
Return success or failure.

3. Email/Phone Change Flow
